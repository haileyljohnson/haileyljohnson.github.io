In today's digital age, security and privacy notifications are critical in protecting users. Yet, systems are not designed to accommodate individuals with cognitive differences, such as those with DS, which can limit their online access [2]. These notifications, which guide users in managing data privacy and security risks, often require background knowledge, timed decisions, or full attention, which may be barriers for users with varying cognitive abilities. Drawing on inclusive security research, this project seeks to address the cognitive accessibility gaps in notification systems. We investigated two research questions: (1) How accessible are security and privacy notifications according to current accessibility design standards?; and (2) How do AwDS choose to interact with security and privacy notifications, and what are their experiences with online security and privacy? 
To answer these questions, we evaluated 20 notification systems against web accessibility and universal design guidelines, identifying key gaps in the notification design and within the guidelines. We then conducted a user study with AwDS to explore their past experiences with online privacy and security and how they interpret and respond to notifications. The project aims to propose and evaluate solutions that make security and privacy notifications more accessible and empowering for users with cognitive disabilities.
