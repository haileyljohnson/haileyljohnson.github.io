In continuing the exploration phase of my research, I conducted a systematic literature review. The main objective was to explore the field of digital technologies designed to support AwDS. This was achieved by identifying (1) the approaches and methods that have been employed in the design of supportive technologies with AwDS; (2) the groups of technologies that have been explored as an instrument for supporting AwDS; (3) the areas of living that the technologies were designed to support; and (4) the benefits and challenges that were identified by AwDS while using the technologies. We additionally outlined four design recommendations derived from the answers to our four research questions combined with an analysis of the results of the 78 publications included: (1) personalization and customization features to promote individualized support; (2) training and feedback systems to enhance user confidence and performance; (3) accessible input methods and user-friendly interfaces for inclusive interaction; and (4) reliable and secure systems to ensure safety and robustness. Finally, based on all our findings, we drew out opportunities for future research in the specific area.
