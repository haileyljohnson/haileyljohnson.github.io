# In progress
The final component of the exploration phase involves a national survey to better understand the technologies used by AwDS and their preferences. This survey aims to answer three research questions: (1) Which hardware, software, and assistive technologies are AwDS currently using, and how often?; (2) Which technologies do AwDS share or own?; and (3) Why do they stop using certain technologies, and how easy are these technologies for them to use?
Designed based on findings from exploratory interviews, the survey includes questions about hardware technology usage (e.g., computers, smartphones, tablets, wearables, AAC devices, AR/VR, etc.), and software applications (e.g., social media, health and wellness, memory support, accessibility features, games, etc.). Participants are recruited through community organizations across the U.S. While it is known that individuals with DS begin using technology from a young age  [4] there is little research on the variety of technologies used by AwDS and their usability. The findings from this survey will provide valuable insights into the scope of technology use in their daily lives, supporting future developers in creating more accessible and effective solutions.
