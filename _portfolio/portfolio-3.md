# In progress
The first co-design study has been designed to answer two key research questions: (1) Do AwDS have a learning modality preference within supportive technologies?; and (2) How effective are different learning modalities between the interactive technologies for AwDS? To address these questions, we designed a study incorporating three distinct technologies: (1) an AR tablet-based application that detects physical elements in a user's space to aid task completion; (2) a gamified tablet-based learning module that teaches concepts in an engaging and fun manner; and (3) a tangible interface that facilitates physical interaction, eliminates multilevel menus, and enables users to adjust the level of assistance preferred to complete a task. We developed usable and interactive probes for this study based on our prior work experience with AwDS. By mixing co-design methods with user study methods, we hope to collect rich participant feedback. A budgeting task, which combines physical and abstract elements, was chosen to highlight the capabilities of each technology. 
Within future co-design studies we aim to answer research question such as: (1) In which physical and social contexts do AwDS envision using visual and tangible technologies to support their occupational goals? And how should the technology shift to each context?; (2) How do designers more effectively create age-considerate visual and tangible interfaces for AwDS?; and (3) What role do customization and personalization play in ensuring visual and tangible technologies meet the diverse needs of AwDS? These future studies aim to deepen our understanding of how to design impactful and context-sensitive technologies for AwDS.
