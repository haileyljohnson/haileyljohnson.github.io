I am a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison advised by [Dr. Bilge Mutlu](http://bilgemutlu.com/) in the [People and Robots Lab](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/). My research focuses on designing and developing supportive technologies for adults with Down syndrome (DS), emphasizing assistive and accessible technologies, augmented reality (AR), and tangible interfaces. In 2023, I was honored to receive the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) to support this work.


## My Research Journey
I am committed to creating inclusive, accessible technologies that enable adults with DS to achieve their personal and occupational goals. My research is guided by a collaborative, user-centered approach that includes building connections with the DS community, engaging in co-design studies, and conducting user studies of technology solutions. Through this process, I strive to bridge the gap between technological innovation and the lived experiences of adults with DS.

Highlights of my work include:

* Conducting qualitative interview studies with adults with DS, their parents, and experts to explore how technology is currently used within thier daily lives and identify opportunities for technology support.
* Completing a systematic scoping literature review to uncover gaps in existing research and inform the design of future assistive technologies.
* Leading technology probe studies to prototype and refine innovative budgeting systems that integrate AR, gamification, and tangible interfaces.
* Assessing computer security and privacy notifications to develop more accessible systems for adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD)

My goal is to ensure that every project centers the voices of adults with DS, designing technologies that are not only functional but also empowering and meaningful.

## Future Vision

My long-term aspiration is to become a professor of Computer Science, focusing on accessibility for individuals with cognitive disabilities. I hope to establish a research program that bridges academia and the community, with graduate students volunteering alongside local organizations to foster meaningful connections. My vision extends beyond academia—I aim to contribute to evolving accessibility guidelines for industry and government, ensuring technology is inclusive for everyone.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my work!

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
